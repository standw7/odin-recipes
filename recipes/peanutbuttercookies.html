	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>My dad's sister gave me this recipe for killer peanut butter cookies made with shortening.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1/2 cup shortening</li>
		<li>1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter</li>
		<li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
		<li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
		<li>1 large egg</li>
		<li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</li>
		<li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
		<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
 	<ol>
 		<li>Cream shortening, peanut butter, and both sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in egg until incorporated. Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; gradually stir into peanut butter mixture until combined. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour.</li>
 		<li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
 		<li>Roll chilled dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Flatten dough balls with a fork dipped in flour to form a crosswise pattern.</li>
 		<li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
 	</ol>
